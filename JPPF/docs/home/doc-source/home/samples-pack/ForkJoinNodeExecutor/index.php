<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This demo demonstrates a node add-on which replaces the standard node processing thread pool with a
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html">fork/join thread pool</a>.
This allows JPPF tasks to locally (in the node) spawn ForkJoinTask (or any of its subclasses) instances and have them processed as expected for a ForkJoinPool.
The use of this fork/join executor is illustrated with a Fibonacci computation demo.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample application, you must have a JPPF server and at least one node running.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/wiki">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>Build the sample, by typing the following command from a shell prompt in the <b>ForkJoinNodeExecutor</b> folder: <b>"mvn clean install"</b></li>
  <li>For a node to use the fork/join executor add-on, you need to add the following property to its configuration file:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-conf">
jppf.thread.manager.class = org.jppf.execute.ThreadManagerForkJoin
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Once this is done, start the server and the node(s)</li>
  <li>From a command prompt, type: <b>&quot;run.bat&quot;</b> (on Windows) or <b>&quot;./run.sh&quot;</b> (on Linux/Unix)</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>This sample doesn't have a graphical user interface, however you can modify some of the parameters in the JPPF configuration file:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open the file "<b>config/jppf.properties</b>" in a text editor</li>
  <li>at the top of the file, you will see the following properties:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-conf">
# number of Fibonacci computation tasks to execute
fib.fj.nbTasks = 10
# order of Fibonacci number to compute
fib.fj.N = 10
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>"<b>fib.fj.nbTasks</b>" allows you change the number of tasks in the submitted job, and thusto simulate various workloads on the grid and especially on the nodes</li>
  <li>"<b>fib.fj.N</b>" is the Fibonacci order, the higher it is the larger the number of spawned fork/join tasks will be</li>
</ol>

<h3>How can I build the sample?</h3>
To compile the source code, from a command prompt type: <b>&quot;ant compile&quot;</b><br>
To generate the Javadoc, from a command prompt type: <b>&quot;ant javadoc&quot;</b>

<h3>I have additional questions and comments, where can I go?</h3>
<p>If you need more insight into the code of this demo, you can consult the source, or have a look at the
<a href="javadoc/index.html">API documentation</a>.
