#   generates less network traffic than the notifications mode, but some updates,
#   possibly entire jobs, may be missed
# - deferred_notifications: updates are received as jmx notifications and published at
#   regular intervals, possibly aggregated during the interval. This mode provides
#   a more accuate view of the jobs life cycle, at the cost of increased network traffic.
# - immediate_notifications: updates are received as jmx notifications and published
#   immediately as job monitoring events which are pushed to the UI. In this mode,
#   all notifications are pushed as events and no aggreagtion occurs, thus no event is
#   missed. However, this may cause memory issues if events are not processed fast enough.
