<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This samples illustrates the implementation of a node connection listener for a JPPF server.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample, you need to install a JPPF server and at least one node.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="http://www.jppf.org/doc/5.2/index.php?title=Introduction">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
Once you have installed a server and node, perform the following steps:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open a command prompt in JPPF-x.y-samples-pack/NodeConnectionEvents</li>
  <li>build the sample: type "<b>ant jar</b>"; this will create a file named <b>NodeConnectionEvents.jar</b></li>
  <li>copy NodeConnectionEvents.jar in the "lib" folder of the JPPF driver installation, to add it to the driver's classpath.</li>
  <li>start the server, in its console you should see the following message:<br/><tt>  [java] *** MyNodeConnectionListener instance successfully loaded ***</tt></li>
  <li>start the node</li>
  <li>in the driver console, you should see the following message:<br/><tt>  [java] *** Node <i>host:port</i> is now connected ***</tt></li>
  <li>get back to the node's shell console and kill the node (for instance with CTRL+C)</li>
  <li>in the driver console, you should now see the following message:<br/><tt>  [java] *** Node <i>host:port</i> is disconnected ***</tt></li>
</ol>
