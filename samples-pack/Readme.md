## About the samples pack

The samples pack is a set of small, self-contained applications that demonstrate the use of JPPF for real-life problems.
Each application can be built and run independantly.
The current applications in the samples pack are:

* [Generation of fractal images (Mandelbrot Set)](Fractals)
* [Protein and DNA sequence alignment](SequenceAlignment)
* [Distributed web crawler and search engine](WebSearchEngine)
* [Tomcat 5.5/6.0 port](TomcatPort)
* [Pluggable management beans sample](CustomMBeans)
* [Network data encryption sample](DataEncryption)
* [Customized server and node initialization sample](StartupClasses)
* [Basic dense matrix multiplication parallelization sample](MatrixMultiplication)
* [Simulation of large portfolio updates](DataDependency)
* [JPPF node health monitor in the system tray](NodeTray)
* [An example of a sophisticated load-balancer implementation](CustomLoadBalancer)
* [Control of database transactions via node life cycle events](NodeLifeCycle)
* [Parallel N-body problem applied to anti-protons trapped in a  magnetic field](Nbody)
* [How to embed and use an FTP server in JPPF](FTPServer)
* [How to receive notifications of nodes connecting and disconnecting on the server](NodeConnectionEvents)
* [Job recovery after an application crash](JobRecovery)
* [Using a node initialization hook to implement a sophisticated failover mechanism](InitializationHook)
* [On-demand management and deployment of appplication libraries in the Grid](ExtendedClassLoading)

* [Generating AVI movies](FractalMovieGenerator) from images produced by the [Mandelbrot fractals sample](Fractals/Readme.html)
* [Dynamically adapting the grid topology based on the current workload](AdaptiveGrid)
* [A demonstration of the patterns for submitting multiple jobs in parallel](ConcurrentJobs)
* [A demonstration of a custom view integrated in the JPPF administration console](PluggableView)
