<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This sample performs the multplication of 2 square dense matrices by dividing the operation into as many JPPF tasks as there are rows in each matrix. Each task multiplies a row of the first matrix by the second matrix.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>the first step is to build the sample: type "<b>mvn clean install</b>" in a command prompt in the "<b>MatrixMultiplication</b>" folder</li>
  <li>Before running this sample application, you must have a JPPF server and at least one node running.<br>
  For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/6.3">JPPF documentation</a>.<br></li>
  <li>Once you have a server and node, from a command prompt, type: "<b>./run.sh</b>" on Linux/Unix/Mac or "<b>run.bat</b>" on Windows</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>This sample doesn't have a graphical user interface, however you can modify some of the parameters in the JPPF configuration file:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open the file "<b>config/jppf-client.properties</b>" in a text editor</li>
  <li>at the end of the file, you will see the following properties:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-conf">
# the size of the matrices to multiply
matrix.size = 300
# number of times the matrix multiplication is performed
matrix.iterations = 100
</pre>

  </li>
  <li>"<b>matrix.size</b>" allows you to experiment with different sizes of the matrices</li>
  <li>"<b>matrix.iterations</b>" is the number of times the matrix multiplication will be performed.
  As the sample simply prints the time per iteration, this will allow you to have a feel as to how the load-balancing algortihm converges toward a near-optimal performance</li>
</ol>
<p>It is interesting to experiment with a different number of nodes and load-balancing algorithm, and test their efficiency in your environment.

<h3>How can I build the sample?</h3>
To compile the source code, from a command prompt, type: <b>&quot;ant compile&quot;</b><br>
To generate the Javadoc, from a command prompt, type: <b>&quot;ant javadoc&quot;</b>

<h3>I have additional questions and comments, where can I go?</h3>
<p>If you need more insight into the code of this demo, you can consult the source, or have a look at the
<a href="javadoc/index.html">API documentation</a>.
