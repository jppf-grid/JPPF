# Startup Classes demo

<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This samples illustrates the implementation of custom startup classes for a JPPF server and node.
Startup classes are wrappers around any arbitrary code that is executed at server or node intialization time.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample, you need to install a JPPF server and at least one node.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/6.3/index.php?title=Introduction">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
Once you have installed a server and node, perform the following steps:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open a command prompt in JPPF-x.y-samples-pack/StartupClasses</li>
  <li>build the sample: type "<b>mvn clean install</b>"; this will create a file named <b>StartupClasses.jar</b> in the <b>target</b> folder</li>
  <li>copy StartupClasses.jar in the "lib" folder of the JPPF driver installation, to add it to the driver's classpath.
  This is enough, as the node will download the startup classes code from the server.</li>
  <li>start the driver, in the driver console, you should see the following message:<br/><tt>  [java] I'm a driver startup class</tt></li>
  <li>start the node, in the node console, you should see the following message:<br/> <tt>  [java] I'm a node startup class</tt></li>
</ol>

<h3>What features of JPPF are demonstrated?</h3>
Pluggable startup classes for JPPF nodes and servers.<br>
Dynamic code deployment from the server to a node.
