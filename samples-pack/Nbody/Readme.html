<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
<p>This sample is a parallel implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem" alt="N_body on Wikipedia">N-body problem</a> for simulating the motion of anti-protons trapped in a magnetic field.<br>
It displays a real-time graphical simulation of the movement of the anti-protons, based on the parameters specified in the configuration file.<br/>
<p>The source in this sample is based on the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/pj/doc/index.html?edu/rit/clu/antimatter/package-summary.html">examples</a> provided in the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/pj.shtml">Java Parallel Library</a>.
<p>Here's a screenshot of the simulation in action:

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample application, you need to install a JPPF server and at least one node.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/6.3/index.php?title=Introduction">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
Once you have installed a server and node, perform the following steps:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open a command prompt in JPPF-x.y-samples-pack/Nbody</li>
  <li>to build the sample: type "<b>mvn clean install</b>"; this will compile all source files in the sample</li>
  <li>to run the simulation, you can either use the batch script "<b>run.bat</b>" on Windows, or "<b>./run.sh</b>" on Linux/Unix/Mac</li>
</ol>
<p>You might also want to play with the simulation parameters to see how they impact the motion of the simulated antiprotons.
They are specified in the configuration file <b>config/jppf.properties</b> as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-conf">
# charge on an antiproton
nbody.qp = 6
# magnetic field strength
nbody.b = 0.42
# simulation radius (size of the graphical panel)
nbody.radius = 300
# granularity of the time steps
nbody.dt = 0.01
# number of bodies (anti protons)
nbody.n = 100
# number of time steps
nbody.time.steps = 13000
# How many bodies (anti protons) per JPPF task
nbody.bodies.per.task = 25
</pre>

<h3>I have additional questions and comments, where can I go?</h3>
