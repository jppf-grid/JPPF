<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This samples illustrates the implementation of a composite serialization for all JPPF network traffic.
The network data is encrypted using a AES cipher with a 128 bits symetric secret key.<br/>
The initial secret key is kept in a keystore, that is included in the resulting jar file deployed to the nodes, servers and clients.
This key is not used to actually encrypt or decrypt the data. Instead, it s used to generate and encrypt a new secret key for each new block of data to encrypt.<br/>
This means that each block of data (i.e a task or data provider) is encrypted with a different key. The resulting block structure is thus as follows:
<ul class="samplesList">
  <li>length of the new key</li>
  <li>content of the new key (encrypted with the initial key)</li>
  <li>actual data (encrypted with the new key)</li>
</ul>

There remains, however, one vulnerability: we still need the keystore password to be stored somewhere, so that we can use the keystore.
To avoid storing this password in clear, we obfuscate it by using a Base64 encoding.
The obfuscated password is then stored in a file, which is also included in the jar file to deploy.

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
First you need to build the sample jar file. To do this, perform the following steps:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>open a command prompt in JPPF-x.y.z-samples-pack/DataEncryption</li>
  <li>build the sample's jar file with a generated keystore with this command: <b>mvn clean install -Dpassword=&lt;keystore_password&gt;</b></li>
  <li>this will create a file named <b>DataEncryption.jar</b> in the <b>target</b> folder</li>
</ol>
The next step is to deploy the jar file to <b><i>every component of the JPPF grid</i></b>, including servers, nodes, and client applications, and to hook it to the JPPF component:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>Add the jar file to the class path of each component: In the case of a server, node or administration console, it is simply a matter of dropping it into the "/lib" folder of the component's root installation path.
    For client applications, you may have to edit the script that launches the application to add the jar to the class path.</li>
  <li>Edit the JPPF configuration file of each component and add the following property:<br>
    <b><code style="font-size: 1em">jppf.object.serialization.class = CRYPTO org.jppf.serialization.DefaultJavaSerialization</code></b></li>
</ol>
Once this is done, you can restart the servers, nodes and clients, and any data sent over the network will be automatically encrypted and secure.

<h3>What features of JPPF are demonstrated?</h3>
Custom transformation and encryption of the JPPF network traffic, allowing to work securely with a JPPF grid.
