<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This sample generates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot fractals</a> images by submitting the computation
to a JPPF grid.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample application, you must have a JPPF server and at least one node running.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/6.3/index.php?title=Introduction">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
Once you have a server and node:
<ol class="samplesList">
  <li>build the sample, by typing the following command in a shell prompt in the <b>"Fractals"</b> folder: <b>"mvn clean install"</b></li>
  <li>you can either run the "<b>run.bat</b>" script (on Windows) or "<b>./run.sh</b>" script (on Linux/Unix)</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>The GUI provides many options and a lot of interactivity.

<h4 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Generating Mandelbrot images</h4>
<p>The &quot;Compute&quot; button submits the image generation for processing by JPPF.
<p>The image generation is governed by a set of 4 parameters:
<ul class="samplesList">
  <li>center X: the X coordinate of the center of the image</li>
  <li>center Y: the Y coordinate of the center of the image</li>
  <li>diameter: this determines the range of possible values of both X and Y axis</li>
  <li>iterations: the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm, before considering that a point &quot;escapes&quot; the Mandelbrot set</li>
</ul>
<i>Tip: modifying the cordinates of the center is equivalent to a "pan" functionality<br>
Tip: modifying the diameter provides, in effect, a zooming capability</i>
<p>You can interact with the image using the mouse:
<ul class="samplesList">
  <li>a left click will zoom-in by the value of the zoom factor, and move the center to the selected point</li>
  <li>a right click will zoom-out by the value of the zoom factor, and move the center to the selected point</li>
</ul>
<p>In the toolbar, the <img src="src/icons/zoomIn.gif" border="0" alt="zoom-in"/> and <img src="src/icons/zoomOut.gif" border="0" alt="zoom-out"/>
buttons provide a static zoom functionality (they do not move the center).<br>
<i>Tip: setting the zoom factor to 1 and clicking left or right in the image is equivalent to panning with the mouse.</i>
<p>Additionally, the dimensions of the image can be set in the <b>config/jppf-client.properties</b> configuration file:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-conf">
# width of the generated images in pixels
image.width = 800
# height of the generated images in pixels
image.height = 600
</pre>
<h4 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Recording and replaying parameters sets</h4>
The sample allows recording multiple sets of parameters (x, y, diameter and iterations) so they can be replayed later, and eventually saved and loaded as CSV files.
The saved files can also be reused by the <a href="../FractalMovieGenerator/Readme.html">Mandelbrot movie generator sample</a>.
<p>The possible actions are:
<ul class="samplesList">
  <li><img src="src/icons/record.gif" border="0" alt="record"/> toggle recording: this switches from recording mode "off" to "on" and vice versa.
  When recording is on, any newly generated image will have its parameters added to the record set</li>
  <li><img src="src/icons/start.gif" border="0" alt="replay"/> replay: replays the current set of records as a slide show, with 2 seconds between images</li>
  <li><img src="src/icons/trash.gif" border="0" alt="clear"/> clear: this removes all records from the current set, which therefore becomes empty</li>
  <li><img src="src/icons/open.gif" border="0" alt="open"/> open: open a previously saved CSV file containng a set of records</li>
  <li><img src="src/icons/save.gif" border="0" alt="save"/> save: save the current record set to a CSV file</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I build the sample?</h3>
To compile the source code, from a command prompt, type: <b>&quot;ant compile&quot;</b><br>
To generate the Javadoc, from a command prompt, type: <b>&quot;ant javadoc&quot;</b>

<h3>I have additional questions and comments, where can I go?</h3>
<p>If you need more insight into the code of this demo, you can consult the source, or have a look at the
<a href="javadoc/index.html">API documentation</a>.
<p>In addition, There are 2 privileged places you can go to:
