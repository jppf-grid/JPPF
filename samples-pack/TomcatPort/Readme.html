<h3>What does the sample do?</h3>
This sample is a simple demonstration of a JPPF client embedded in a web application and running within a Tomcat container.<br>
It has been tested with <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Apache Tomcat</a> versions 5.5 and 6.0.

<h3>How do I run it?</h3>
Before running this sample application, you must have a JPPF server and at least one node running.<br>
For information on how to set up a node and server, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/6.3/index.php?title=Introduction">JPPF documentation</a>.<br>
Once you have a server and node, from a command prompt, perform the following steps:
<ul class="samplesList">
  <li>configure the application settings, by editing the configuration files (JPPF and logging) in the <b>TomcatPort/src/main/resources</b> folder</li>
  <li>from a shell or command prompt, type: <b>"mvn clean install"</b>. This will build a WAR file named <b>TomcatPort.war</b>,
  which embeds a JPPF client, in the <b>TomcatPort/target</b> folder.</li>
  <li>deploy the WAR file to Tomcat (usually by copying it to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps)</li>
  <li>start Tomcat</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
To use this sample, open a browser at this URL: http://<i>tomcat_host</i>:<i>tomcat_port</i>/jppftest<br>
If your Tomcat installation is local and uses the default port, you can go directly to this URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jppftest" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/jppftest</a>

<h3>What integration features of JPPF are demonstrated?</h3>
Integration with the Tomcat Servlets/JSP container.

<h3>I have additional questions and comments, where can I go?</h3>
<p>If you need more insight into the code of this demo, you can consult the JSP source files located in the <b>TomcatPort/src/resources</b> folder.
