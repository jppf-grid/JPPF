 * Interface for facilities managing the persistence of jobs and their state.
 * It is intended to enable the storage of jobs in a persistent store, so as to be able
 * to resubmit them at a later time, if the client terminated for any reason before the job completed.
 * <p>The state of a job is essentially made of the tasks initially submitted, associated with the list of tasks that completed.
 * <p>The underlying physical store that is used is implementation-dependent. For example: file system, database, cloud storage facility, etc.
 * @param <K> the type of the keys used to identify and locate jobs in the persistence store.
