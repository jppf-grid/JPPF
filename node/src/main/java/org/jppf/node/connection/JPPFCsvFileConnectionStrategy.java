/**
 * This implementation of {@link DriverConnectionStrategy} reads a list of drivers
 * from a CSV file where each line has the following format:
 * <p><code>secure, host, port, recovery_enabled</code>
 * <p>where:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>secure</i> is a boolean value (either 'true' or 'false', case-insenssitive) indicating whether a SSL/TLS connection should be established.
 * any value that is not 'true' will be interpreted as 'false'.</li>
 * <li><i>host</i> is the host name or ip address of the driver to connect to</li>
 * <li><i>port</i> is the port to connect to on the driver host</li>
 * <li><i>recovery_enabled</i> is a boolean value (either 'true' or 'false', case-insenssitive) indicating whether the recovery (or heartbeat) mechanism is enabled for the node</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Additionally, any line starting with a '#' (after trimming) will be considered as a comment and ignored.
 * <p>The file location is read from the configuration property {@code 'jppf.node.connection.strategy.file'}.
 * It will  first be looked up in the file system, then in the classpath if it is not found in the file system.
 * If no file is found at all, the node will fall back to the {@link JPPFDefaultConnectionStrategy JPPF default strategy} and use the configuration to find the driver connection information.
 * <p>The listed drivers will be used as if they were arrayed in a "circle",
 * with the driver selection mechanism rotating one tick each time {@code nextConnectionInfo()} is invoked.
