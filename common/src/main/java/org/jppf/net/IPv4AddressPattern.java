/**
 * Represents a pattern used for IP addresses include or exclude lists.<br/>
 * A pattern represents a single value or a range of values for each component of an IP address.<br/>
 * <p>Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>192.168.1.10 represents a single IP address</li>
 * <li>192.168.1 represents all IP addresses in the range 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255</li>
 * <li>192.168 represents all IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</li>
 * <li>192.168-170.10 represents all IP addresses where the first component is equal to 192, the second in the range 168 - 170, the third equal to 10, and the fourth in the range 0 - 255
 * (equivalent to 192.168-170.10.0-255)</li>
 * <li>192.168-170.10.1-32 represents all IP addresses where the first component is equal to 192, the second in the range 12 - 120, the third equal to 10, and the fourth in the range 1 - 32</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Syntax rules:
 * <p>1. An empty component is considered as a 0-255 range. Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>.2.3.4 is equivalent to 0-255.2.3.4</li>
 * <li>1.2..4 is equivalent to 1.2.0-255.4</li>
 * <li>1.2.3. is equivalent to 1.2.3 and to 1.2.3.0-255</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>2. Ranges with missing bounds but still including the &quot;-&quot; sign are interpreted as a range with the lower bound
 * equal to zero for a missing lower bound, and an upper bound equal to 255 if the upper bound is missing. Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>-128 is equivalent to 0-128</li>
 * <li>12- is equivalent to 12-255</li>
 * <li>- is equivalent to an empty value and to 0-255</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>3. Valid values for range bounds and single values are positive integers in the range 0 ... 255. A pattern containing any invalid value will be ignored.
 * <p>4. A pattern describing more than 4 components or containing characters other than decimal digits, '-', '.' or spaces will be ignored.
