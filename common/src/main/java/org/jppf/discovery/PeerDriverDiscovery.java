/**
 * Abstract superclass for custom peer driver discovery mechanisms in JPPF drivers.
 * The discovery is asynchhronus and the {@link #discover()} method of each instance runs in a separate thread.
 * <p>To notify the driver that a new peer driver is discovered, the {@link DriverDiscovery#newConnection(DriverConnectionInfo) newConnection(DriverConnectionInfo)} method must be called.
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyPeerDiscovery extends PeerDriverDiscovery {
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void discover() {
 *     newConnection(new DriverConnectionInfo("driver1", false, "localhost", 11111));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>Peer driver discovery mechanisms are found in the classpath via the service provider interface (SPI):
 * <ul>
 * <li>create a file named {@code META-INF/services/org.jppf.discovery.PeerDriverDiscovery}</li>
 * <li>in this file, for each discovery implementation add a line with the fully qualified name of the implementation class,
 * for instance: {@code org.jppf.example.MyPeerDiscovery}</li>
 * </ul>
