/**
 * Abstract superclass for custom driver discovery mechanisms in JPPF clients.
 * The discovery is asynchhronus and the {@link #discover()} method of each instance runs in a separate thread.
 * <p>To notify the client that a new driver is discovered, the {@link DriverDiscovery#newConnection(DriverConnectionInfo) newConnection(ClientConnectionPoolInfo)} method must be called.
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyDiscovery extends ClientDriverDiscovery {
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void discover() {
 *     newConnection(new ClientConnectionPoolInfo("driver1", false, "localhost", 11111, 0, 1, 1));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>The name given to the connection pool information is used as a prefix for individual connection names, which are numbered starting from 1
 * and have the following format: "<i>pool_name</i>-<i>n</i>", where <i>n</i> is the connection number. In the example above, the individual
 * connections will be named "driver1-1", "driver1-2", etc ...
 * <p>Client driver discovery mechanisms are found in the classpath via the service provider interface (SPI):
 * <ul>
 * <li>create a file named {@code META-INF/services/org.jppf.discovery.ClientDriverDiscovery}</li>
 * <li>in this file, for each discovery implementation add a line with the fully qualified name of the implementation class,
 * for instance: {@code org.jppf.example.MyDiscovery}</li>
 * </ul>
 * @since 5.2.1
