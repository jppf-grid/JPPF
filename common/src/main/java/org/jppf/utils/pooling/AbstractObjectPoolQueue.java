 * A thread-safe, dynamic object pool backed by a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue}.
 * This pool is designed for maximum throughput, thus its size will grow dynamically,
 * up to maximum concurrent usage.
 * <p>Subclasses that wish to avoid a size too large for the pool may for instance
 * introduce a core pool size, and override the <code>put(T)</code> method such that it
 * doesn't put released object back into the queue if its size > core size.
 * <p>In this case the {@link #size()} method might need to be overriden as well, as its
 * performance in O(n) may be the main bottleneck of the implementation.
 * @param <T> the type of objects in the pool.
