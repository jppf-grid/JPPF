 * An extension of {@link AbstractObjectPoolQueue} which specifies a maximum size for the pool.

 * the <code>put(T)</code> method does not return an element to the backing queue if the pool size >= max size.
 * <p> the {@link #size()} method is also overriden to provide results in constant time insteat of O(n) in
 * the super class, since it is used frequently when comparing current pool size with the max size.
 * @param <T> the type of the elements in the pool.
