/**
 * This interface class represents objects that are run at client startup time.
 * <p>More precisely, they are run just before any connection with a driver is established.
 * <p>Classes implementing this interface must have a public no-arg constructor and implement the {@link java.lang.Runnable#run() run()} method.
 * <p>Client startup classes allow a developer to perform initializations at runtime, such as load specific APIs,
 * create connection pools, subscribe to the monitoring MBeans notifications, etc. The range of applications is quite broad.
 * <p>They are looked up by using the Service Provider Interface (SPI) lookup mechanism.
 * For the SPI to find them, proceed as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>in the classpath root create, if it does not exist, a folder named META-INF/services</li>
 * <li>in this folder create a file named &quot;org.jppf.startup.JPPFClientStartupSPI&quot;</li>
 * <li>the content of this file is one or more line(s) with the fully qualified class name of an implementation of this interface</li>
 * <li>to specify multiple implementations, just put one per line in the file</li>
 * <li>there can also be multiple META-INF/services/org.jppf.startup.JPPFClientStartupSPI resources in the classpath
 * (for instance in multiple jar files); all of them will be looked up and processed</li>
 * </ul>
