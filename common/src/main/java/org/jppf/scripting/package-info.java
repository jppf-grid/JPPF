/**
 * Support for embedded scripting within JPPF.
 * <p>Discovery of available script languages is made via SPI:
 * <ul>
 * <li>each language provider must be cdecalred in a file named {@code META-INF/services/org.jppf.scripting.ScriptRunner},
 * where each line contains the fully qualified name of a class implementing {@link org.jppf.scripting.ScriptRunner ScriptRunner} with a no-args constructor</li>
 * <li>the discovered script runners are grouped by language and can be accessed via the {@link org.jppf.scripting.ScriptRunnerFactory ScriptRunnerFactory} static methods</li>
 * </ul>
