/**
 * This interface must be implemented by services that perform persistence of load-balancers state.
 * The configuration of an implementation is performed in the JPPF configuration as follows:<br/>
 * {@code jppf.load.balancing.persistence = <persistence_implementation_class_name> [param1 ... paramN]}
 * <p>The implementation class must declare either a no-arg constructor or a constructor that takes a {@code String[]} or {@code String...} parameter, or both.
 * The space-separated optional parameters allow setting up the persistence implementation from the JPPF configuration.
 * They could be used for instance to specify the root directory for a file-based implementation, or JDBC connection parameters, but are not limited to these.
 * <p>An implementation that only declares a no-args constructor may still receive parameters if it declares a {@code void setParameters(String...params)} method.
