/**
 * Classes supporting the <a href="https://www.jppf.org/doc/@version@/index.php?title=Load-balancer_state_persistence">persistence of the state of a load-balancer</a>.
 * <p>This is particularly useful for adaptive load-balancers, as it allows
 * them to be immediately in an optimal efficiency state and  skip (most of) the convergence phase.
 * <p>Interfaces and classes in this package are common to server-side and client-side load-balancing.
 * In particular, identical mechanisms are used for the configuration, implementation and management of the load-balancers persistence.
 * <p>Found in: <b>jppf-common.jar</b>
