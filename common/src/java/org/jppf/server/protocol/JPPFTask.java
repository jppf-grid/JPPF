/**
 * Abstract superclass for all tasks submitted to the execution server.
 * This class provides the basic facilities to handle data shared among tasks, handling of task execution exception,
 * and handling of the execution results.<p>
 * JPPF clients have to extend this class and must implement the <code>run</code> method. In the
 * <code>run</code> method the task calculations are performed, and the result of the calculations
 * is set with the {@link #setResult(Object)} method:
 * <pre>
 * class MyTask extends JPPFTask {
 *   public void run() {
 *     // do the calculation ...
 *     setResult(myResult);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
